Open work and open decisions. Items keep their number for good; when one is
done or decided, it moves to [Done](done.md) with a short note, and items
that no longer apply go to its **Dropped** section.

q.e.d. is a single-user desktop app (Rust + Tauri) that turns a podcaster's
content into a static site and publishes it. Decided 2026-10-21; it replaces
the earlier Phoenix web app.

## To decide

Nothing open.

## To build

### Phase 3:  In progress

- **#110 Manual.** A user manual inside the app, also reachable from
  where a topic comes up, and the same pages on the docs site, for site
  owners and editors, not developers. First part done 2026-10-29, post
  65: decided that the pages live in `docs/pages/manual/`, compiled into
  the app (`qed_core::manual`, offline, built in the app's theme, shown
  in a second window; outside links open in the browser); a life-buoy
  button next to the preview button and **Manual** links in the Pages,
  Media, Publish and Versions tabs. Pages so far: start, getting
  started, pages and blocks, pictures and files, versions,
  [Backups](manual/backups.md) (#037, moved there), publishing. Still to
  write: themes and fonts, moving a site over, icons in text
  (`:icon-phone:`, #114, with the list of icons), the hand-made menu
  (#111), boxed columns (#113), podcasts.

### Phase 4: Future

- **#070 Code signing.** For downloads from the releases page, not app
  stores. macOS: notarization needs the Apple Developer Program (99 USD
  a year); without it, macOS 15 and later make people allow the app in
  System Settings (right-click → Open no longer works). Windows: the
  SignPath Foundation signs open-source projects for free (builds from
  CI; check their terms); SmartScreen still warns until the app has a
  reputation. Updates are already safe through the updater's own
  signature. Moved here on 2026-10-29: worth it once Mac users come in.
- **#123 Import from Podlove Publisher.** Bring a podcast over from
  WordPress with the
  [Podlove Publisher](https://podlove.org/podlove-podcast-publisher/)
  plugin, mostly to archive it without having to keep WordPress running
  (user, 2026-10-28): podcast settings, episodes with shownotes,
  chapters, contributors (#047), transcripts (#048), cover art and the
  audio in every format, the old episode guids (so apps don't show
  everything again) and the old addresses as redirects. To decide:
  the source (Podlove's own export file, the feeds, the WordPress REST
  API, or a mix), and how much of the shownotes' HTML becomes Markdown.
  Related: #034 (import from a feed or jekyll-octopod).
- **#034 Feed import.** Import an existing podcast from its RSS feed or
  from a jekyll-octopod site (compare `octopod import`). Keep each
  episode's old guid (octopod used the episode's address) and its old
  address as a redirect. Moved here on 2026-10-28, with #123.
- **#124 Feed redirects.** Podlove Publisher's feeds live at other
  addresses (`/feed/mp3/`, or `/?feed=…` without pretty links) than
  q.e.d.'s (`/episodes.mp3.rss`), and subscribers must keep getting new
  episodes after the move (from #123). A static site can't answer with
  an HTTP 301 by itself. To decide, per target: a `<itunes:new-feed-url>`
  feed at the old address (Apple and most apps then switch for good; works
  on any host, also GitHub Pages, but not for `?feed=` addresses), an
  `.htaccess` with `Redirect 301` rules for Apache hosts (handles query
  strings too), or both. Old feed addresses per format would be a
  podcast setting, filled in by the import.
